  <h2>Data processing</h2>
  <p>The original dataset showcasing the full data was created by Adam Halper and downloaded from data.world.
    The link to the dataset can be found <a href="https://data.world/ahalps/social-influence-on-shopping">here</a>.</p>
  <p>When inspecting the original dataset, there were a lot of rows (1452) where majority of them could not be used
  as none of the segment groups except 'male voters' and 'female voters' described the distribution of male and female
  voters. To deal with this, python code was written to remove all the rows which didn't have the segment groups
    'male voters' and 'female voters' so that the dataset could be inspected properly to see the total count of
  the two genders. After realising that there was an imbalance in numbers between the two genders, the total count
  column was disregarded as percentage was a better measure.</p>
  <p>Following these steps, there were only 10 rows of data remaining where the only meaningful columns were the
  segment description showing the gender, the social media platform answer and the percentage column. As there was not
  a strenuous amount of data and relatively easy to structure in a hierarchical manner, the data was formatted into a JSON format within
  the code where each gender category has an array of objects that specifies the platform and its corresponding percentage.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The JSON format is more structured than CSV whilst allowing for nested data and supports more complex data types, such as arrays and objects.
    This makes it easier to represent the hierarchical structure of the data. In addition, JSON has built-in support for key-value pairs making
    it easy to work with in JavaScript and requires less parsing and manipulating than CSV to achieve the same effect. </p>
